# Student Performance Prediction Project

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict a student's **Performance Index** based on various input features. The project involves exploring, analyzing, and modeling data to gain insights and make accurate predictions.

## Input Features
1. **Hours Studied**
2. **Previous Scores**
3. **Extracurricular Activities**
4. **Sleep Hours**
5. **Sample Question Papers Practiced**

## Output Feature
- **Performance Index**

## Steps Completed
### 1. Data Exploration and Understanding
- Analyzed the dataset to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.
- Identified patterns and trends in the data.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Ensured all data types were appropriate for analysis.

### 3. Visualization
Generated various plots to visualize the data:
- **Pair Plot**
- **Line Plot**
- **Count Plot**

### 4. Model Implementation
Implemented and evaluated the following regression models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**

## Outcomes
